Gaité Dufloux lived a luxurious and elegant life, and this beautiful image began to take root in Aimée&#39;s mind.</p><p>In psychology, this situation is called <code>projective identification</code>, where an individual projects their emotions, desires, or traits onto others.</p><p>Aimée&#39;s attack may have stemmed from her extreme obsession with the ideal image and her psychological masochism. She projected her ideal image onto the actress, to the point where this projection became pathological, leading her to develop <code>paranoia</code>. By attacking the actress, she achieved a form of self-validation on an imaginary level.</p><h2 id="ego-identification" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ego-identification"><span>Ego Identification</span></a></h2><p>The concept of the <code>ego</code> can indeed be seen as the result of a complex interaction between internal desires and external projections. In Lacan&#39;s theory, an individual&#39;s ego is not only driven by internal desires but also by how the external world is projected and perceived by the individual. The inner bodily desire subject and the external projective body together construct a complex imaginary structure.</p><figure><img src="'+i+'" alt="Mirror" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Mirror</figcaption></figure><p>Idol worship and fan phenomena are typical examples of this external psychological structure. People project their fantasies and desires onto celebrities, gaining emotional and psychological satisfaction, and using celebrities to build and confirm their self-identity.</p><p>When idols are attacked, fans&#39; reactions can be seen as responses to threats to their own psychological structures. They feel not only a threat to the idol but also to their own identity and fantasy structures. This emotional and psychological mechanism leads fans to passionately and devotedly protect their idols.</p><p>As Freud said, the &quot;ideal self&quot; is a part beyond the superego, representing an individual&#39;s fantasy and pursuit of a perfect self. This part can be seen as an initial description of the external psychological structure.
