However, to make photos artistic and thoughtful, mastering some photography <code>composition</code> techniques is essential. It includes not only the positional relationships of subjects in the picture, but also aspects such as color, focal length, depth of field, and more.</p><p>The core of composition lies in how to skillfully arrange and handle the position and relationship of various elements within a limited space, thereby effectively conveying the artist&#39;s creative intent and emotions.</p><h2 id="_1-center-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-center-composition"><span>1. Center Composition</span></a></h2><p>Center composition is a classic and effective method, especially suitable for beginners or specific scenarios. Placing the subject in the center of the frame can directly attract the viewer&#39;s attention, making the theme more prominent.</p><p>Main shooting methods include:</p><h3 id="large-aperture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#large-aperture"><span>Large Aperture</span></a></h3><p>Use a large-aperture lens to reduce depth of field and blur the background.</p><h3 id="long-focal-length" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#long-focal-length"><span>Long Focal Length</span></a></h3><p>Use a telephoto lens to compress the perspective. If no telephoto lens is available, close-up shooting can be used instead.</p><figure><img src="'+o+'" alt="Center Composition" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Center Composition</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_2-three-part-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-three-part-composition"><span>2. Three-part Composition</span></a></h2><p>Divide the frame into nine equal parts to better arrange the position of the subject, making the photo more balanced and aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Main shooting methods include:</p><h3 id="grids" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#grids"><span>Grids</span></a></h3><p>Divide the frame into nine equal small squares with two horizontal and two vertical lines intersecting to form four intersection points.</p><h3 id="intersection-points" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#intersection-points"><span>Intersection Points</span></a></h3><p>These intersection points are the most visually appealing places. Placing the subject or important elements at these points can attract the viewer&#39;s attention.</p><p>Placing the shooting subject at the intersection points or along these lines can create more dynamic and visually attractive photos.</p><figure><img src="'+i+'" alt="Three-part Composition" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Three-part Composition</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_3-leading-lines-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-leading-lines-composition"><span>3. Leading Lines Composition</span></a></h2><p>Place one (or more) lines in the frame, allowing the subject to align with these lines.</p><p>The lines can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or curved; they can also be negative lines, converging lines, parallel lines, spiral lines, etc.</p><h3 id="horizontal-lines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#horizontal-lines"><span>Horizontal Lines</span></a></h3><p>For horizontal lines, you can divide the frame into three equal horizontal sections, placing the horizontal line at the top third or bottom third of the frame.</p><p>Applicable scenes include the sky, ground, water surface, etc.</p><figure><img src="'+t+'" alt="Horizontal Lines" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Horizontal Lines</figcaption></figure><h3 id="vertical-lines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vertical-lines"><span>Vertical Lines</span></a></h3><p>For vertical lines, usable lines include vertical elements such as buildings and tree trunks.</p><h3 id="non-line-lines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#non-line-lines"><span>Non-line Lines</span></a></h3><p>In addition, think outside the box and capture &quot;non-line lines,&quot; such as shadows, the flow of people or traffic, color contrasts, and spatial contrasts.</p><figure><img src="'+n+'" alt="Color Diagonal Composition" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Color Diagonal Composition</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_4-symmetrical-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-symmetrical-composition"><span>4. Symmetrical Composition</span></a></h2><p>Symmetrical composition is an extension of leading lines composition.</p><p>It uses symmetrical shapes to highlight the subject. Symmetrical elements can come from architecture, nature, and people.</p><figure><img src="'+a+'" alt="Symmetrical Composition" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Symmetrical Composition</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_5-depth-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-depth-composition"><span>5. Depth Composition</span></a></h2><p>Use the foreground to increase the depth and layers of the picture. When the foreground objects and the subject are distinct, the clear contrast between the front and back can further highlight the subject.</p><p>You can use frames such as doors, windows, holes, glasses, etc. You can also use small objects in front of the camera, such as birds in flight, water droplets, etc.</p><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="Depth Composition" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Depth Composition</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_6-geometric-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-geometric-composition"><span>6. Geometric Composition</span></a></h2><p>Create several geometric shapes in the frame by arranging the subject and other elements.</p><p>Common geometric elements include diagonals and triangles.</p><p>The use of diagonals and triangles in composition can add more beauty and tension to the image.</p><h3 id="diagonal-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#diagonal-composition"><span>Diagonal Composition</span></a></h3><p>Diagonals can guide the viewer&#39;s eye from one end to the other, creating a sense of motion. For example, in landscape photography, a diagonal line can be a river, road, or ridge line, leading the viewer&#39;s eye across the entire image.</p><h3 id="triangular-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#triangular-composition"><span>Triangular Composition</span></a></h3><p>Triangles in composition can be explicit (clear triangular shapes) or implicit (triangles formed by the positional relationship of elements). This composition method can not only create a sense of balance but also increase the interest of the composition. For example, a typical triangular composition might be in portrait photography, where the eyes, nose, and mouth form a triangle.</p><figure><img src="'+r+'" alt="Geometric Composition" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Geometric Composition</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_7-golden-ratio-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-golden-ratio-composition"><span>7. Golden Ratio Composition</span></a></h2><p>Compose based on the golden ratio.</p><p>The golden ratio is widely present in nature, art, and architecture, and is considered to create harmonious and visually appealing effects.</p><h3 id="golden-ratio-rectangle-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#golden-ratio-rectangle-composition"><span>Golden Ratio Rectangle Composition</span></a></h3><p>The golden ratio rectangle is a rectangle with an aspect ratio of the golden ratio (1:1.618). The frame is divided into a larger rectangle and a smaller rectangle, with the smaller rectangle also having the golden ratio aspect ratio.</p><p>For example, in portrait photography, the golden ratio can help determine the position of the person, making them look more natural and harmonious.</p><h3 id="golden-spiral-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#golden-spiral-composition"><span>Golden Spiral Composition</span></a></h3><p>The golden spiral is a curve that starts from one corner of the rectangle and expands with the spiral. The spiral draws the focus of the image to a specific area, guiding the viewer&#39;s eye.</p><p>For example, in landscape photography, the golden spiral can be used to guide the eye from the foreground to the background.</p><figure><img src="'+l+'" alt="Golden Ratio Composition" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Golden Ratio Composition</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_8-blank-space-composition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-blank-space-composition"><span>8.
