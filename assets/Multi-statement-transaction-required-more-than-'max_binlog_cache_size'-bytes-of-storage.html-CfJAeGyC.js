The binary log cache is used to temporarily hold the transaction&#39;s modifications, and when the size exceeds the predefined limit, this error is triggered. Key contributing factors include:</p><ul><li>Extensive data modification within a single transaction.</li><li>Transactions composed of numerous SQL statements.</li><li>The <code>max_binlog_cache_size</code> setting is too low to accommodate the transaction&#39;s demands.</li></ul><h2 id="solutions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#solutions"><span>Solutions</span></a></h2><h3 id="increasing-max-binlog-cache-size" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#increasing-max-binlog-cache-size"><span>Increasing <code>max_binlog_cache_size</code></span></a></h3><p>To address this issue, you can increase the <code>max_binlog_cache_size</code> parameter.
