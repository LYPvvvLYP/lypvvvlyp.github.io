backup database, or utilizing temporary storage mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Working Principle</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Read-Only Mode</strong>: Switch to read-only mode when the database is not writable to ensure that query operations remain unaffected.</li><li><strong>Backup Database</strong>: Utilize master-slave replication or multi-master architecture to automatically switch to a backup database when the primary database fails.</li><li><strong>Temporary Storage</strong>: Temporarily store critical data locally or in cache when the database is completely unavailable, synchronizing it back to the database once it is restored.</li></ol><h3 id="cache" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cache"><span>Cache</span></a></h3><p>When the cache service is unavailable, the system can reduce its dependency on the cache through degradation strategies, directly accessing the database or limiting certain non-critical functions.</p><p><strong>Working Principle</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Direct Database Access</strong>: Access the database directly when the cache fails, which may increase response time but ensures data availability.</li><li><strong>Cache Strategy Adjustment</strong>: Adjust cache expiration times and strategies to reduce dependency on the cache, prioritizing core business cache.</li></ol><h3

messages locally or in the database when the message queue is unavailable, processing them once the queue is restored.</li><li><strong>Backup Queue</strong>: Configure a backup message queue to automatically switch to it when the primary queue is unavailable, ensuring reliable message delivery.</li><li><strong>Critical Message Processing</strong>: Prioritize processing critical business

replacing the ES service with database full-text search.</li><li><strong>Delayed Search</strong>: Process search requests after the search service is restored, notifying users that search results will
