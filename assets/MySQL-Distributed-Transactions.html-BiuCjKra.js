The first phase is the preparation phase, where the coordinator node sends a prepare request to all participating nodes. Each node executes the transaction and logs the operation but does not commit it, awaiting the coordinator&#39;s final instruction. In the second phase, if all nodes are ready, the coordinator sends a commit request and all nodes commit the transaction. If any node fails, the coordinator sends a rollback request, and all nodes rollback the transaction.</p><h3 id="three-phase-commit-protocol" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#three-phase-commit-protocol"><span>Three-Phase Commit Protocol</span></a></h3><p>The three-phase commit protocol (3PC) extends the two-phase commit protocol by adding a pre-commit phase to minimize waiting time between the coordinator and participants. In this phase, the coordinator sends a pre-commit request. If all nodes respond as ready, the coordinator then sends the final commit request. If any node fails during the pre-commit phase, the coordinator issues a rollback request. This protocol improves reliability and reduces the likelihood of single points of failure by refining the commit process.</p><h2 id="internal-xa-transactions-and-external-xa-transactions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#internal-xa-transactions-and-external-xa-transactions"><span>Internal XA Transactions and External XA Transactions</span></a></h2><h3 id="internal-xa-transactions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#internal-xa-transactions"><span>Internal XA Transactions</span></a></h3><p>Internal XA transactions occur within a single database server, involving multiple databases. They utilize the InnoDB storage engine&#39;s XA transaction capability to manage transactions, ensuring data consistency across multiple databases on the same server. Internal XA transactions coordinate between the involved databases to maintain atomicity and consistency.</p><h3 id="external-xa-transactions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#external-xa-transactions"><span>External XA Transactions</span></a></h3><p>External XA transactions, on the other hand, are conducted across multiple independent database servers. These transactions require a global transaction manager (such as an application server) to coordinate the databases on different servers. Managing external XA transactions is more complex due to the need for cross-network communication and synchronization, while ensuring data consistency across all participating nodes.</p><h2 id="risks-of-mysql-distributed-transactions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#risks-of-mysql-distributed-transactions"><span>Risks of MySQL Distributed Transactions</span></a></h2><p>The primary risks of MySQL distributed transactions include network latency and transaction inconsistency due to failures. Network delays can impact transaction execution speed and increase data locking time. Additionally, a failure in any one node can cause the entire transaction to rollback, increasing the likelihood of transaction failure. The coordination and management of distributed transactions are more complex than single-node transactions, requiring more resources and sophisticated error-handling mechanisms to ensure data consistency and system reliability.</p>',14)]))}const d=a(s,[["render",o],["__file","MySQL-Distributed-Transactions.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/Computer/MySQL/MySQL-Distributed-Transactions.html","title":"MySQL Distributed Transactions","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"date":"2024-11-23T15:31:46.000Z","updated":"2024-12-05T14:58:06.000Z","title":"MySQL Distributed Transactions","shortTitle":"MySQL Distributed Transactions","description":"This article delves into the principles and implementation of MySQL distributed transactions, covering data consistency, XA transactions, and two-phase commit, and explores performance optimization strategies suitable for advanced database developers and operations engineers.","category":["Computer"],"tag":["MySQL"]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Definition of MySQL Distributed Transactions","slug":"definition-of-mysql-distributed-transactions","link":"#definition-of-mysql-distributed-transactions","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Implementing MySQL Distributed Transactions","slug":"implementing-mysql-distributed-transactions","link":"#implementing-mysql-distributed-transactions","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Two-Phase Commit Protocol","slug":"two-phase-commit-protocol","link":"#two-phase-commit-protocol","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Three-Phase Commit Protocol","slug":"three-phase-commit-protocol","link":"#three-phase-commit-protocol","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Internal XA Transactions and External XA Transactions","slug":"internal-xa-transactions-and-external-xa-transactions","link":"#internal-xa-transactions-and-external-xa-transactions","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Internal XA Transactions","slug":"internal-xa-transactions","link":"#internal-xa-transactions","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"External XA Transactions","slug":"external-xa-transactions","link":"#external-xa-transactions","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Risks of MySQL Distributed Transactions","slug":"risks-of-mysql-distributed-transactions","link":"#risks-of-mysql-distributed-transactions","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1732350748000,"updatedTime":1733409411000,"contributors":[{"name":"LYPvvvLYP","email":"1909266427@qq.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.68,"words":504},"filePathRelative":"Computer/MySQL/MySQL Distributed Transactions.md","localizedDate":"November 23, 2024","excerpt":"<h2>Definition of MySQL Distributed Transactions</h2>\\n<p>Distributed transactions in MySQL involve executing transactions across multiple independent database nodes.
