The thread pool effectively controls the number of threads, avoiding resource contention and performance degradation due to too many threads. By reasonably configuring thread pool parameters, the efficiency of Parallel Replication can be optimized.</p><h3 id="dependency-management" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dependency-management"><span>Dependency Management</span></a></h3><p>When processing transaction logs, it is crucial to ensure the proper management of dependencies between transactions. Some transactions depend on the results of previous operations and must be executed in the correct order. Managing these dependencies ensures the accuracy and consistency of transactions.</p><h3 id="transaction-isolation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#transaction-isolation"><span>Transaction Isolation</span></a></h3><p>During Parallel Replication, each transaction must execute within its isolation level. Operations between different transactions should not interfere with each other to ensure data consistency and integrity. Using appropriate transaction isolation mechanisms can effectively prevent data conflicts and inconsistencies caused by parallel processing.</p><h3 id="monitoring-and-adjustment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#monitoring-and-adjustment"><span>Monitoring and Adjustment</span></a></h3><p>Real-time monitoring of the execution status of each thread is essential during Parallel Replication, along with dynamic adjustments based on actual conditions. By monitoring log processing progress and system resource usage, the performance of Parallel Replication can be optimized, and potential issues can be promptly addressed.</p><h2 id="problems-caused-by-mysql-parallel-replication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#problems-caused-by-mysql-parallel-replication"><span>Problems Caused by MySQL Parallel Replication</span></a></h2><h3 id="deadlock" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deadlock"><span>Deadlock</span></a></h3><p>Parallel Replication can cause deadlocks when multiple threads simultaneously attempt to acquire the same lock resource.
