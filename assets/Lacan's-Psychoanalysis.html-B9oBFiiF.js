These imitative gestures serve as specular image to him. Human beings are completely deceived by specular images. This is the basic reason why the <code>Imaginary</code> affects the <code>Subject</code>, and it also explains why humans project this image of their bodies onto all other objects in the surrounding environment.</p><p>Infant&#39;s joyful identification with the specular image reflects the narcissistic structure of <code>ego</code>. This identification is called mirror identification.</p><p>At this time, infant&#39;s libido is directed towards some partial objects, mainly individual parts of the body.</p><p>Infant will soon realize that if he cannot verbalize his demands, his parents will not meet his needs as well as before.

The presence of words comes at the expense of the absence of objects, which is a murder of objects.</p><p>The moment when Subject enters the language order is the moment when Subject registers his desires in the Symbolic.</p><p>Symbolization is embodied in the murder of objects, and the death (mortality) of objects leads to the eternity of Subject&#39;s desires.</p><p>Subject identifies with the symbolic order (father law) through symbolic identification, and at the same time Subject becomes a castrated Subject.

Our words, deeds, and thoughts are all affected and dominated by the language environment and interact with it.

It marks this rediscovery with an impossible repetition, precisely because the rediscovered object is not and cannot be the same lost object. It sets a fundamental tension at the center of the Subject-Object relation, ensuring that what is sought can never be sought in the same way as it is found.</p><p>The Object appears in the process of rediscovering the lost Object. Objects are always rediscovered objects.</p><p>The basic Object is first and foremost a missing Object, a lost Object that Subject wants to rediscover. Absence is the core of object relation.</p><p>Under language, a real Object is transformed into a present/absent Object, and love is an example of such a present/absent Object.</p><p>Object a is taken as the cause of desire, and it is the essence of desire that can never be chased. Object a happens to be what is forever lost. So desired object always serves as a substitute for object a.</p><p>Subject moves from the self-sufficient state of omnipotent fantasy into the linguistic dimension, and object a is then left behind, which is a product of castration. As a result, human becomes the subject of desire, and he will constantly try to retrieve object a, or rather, try to retrieve the &quot;umbilical cord&quot;.</p><p>The unsatisfied needs introduce Lack into the world of Subject, and the symbolization of children then begins.</p><h4 id="metonymy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#metonymy"><span>Metonymy</span></a></h4><p>Desire is a metonymy.</p><h3 id="theory-of-desire" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#theory-of-desire"><span>Theory of Desire</span></a></h3><p>The Subject&#39;s object of desire is always unavailable and all efforts will always fail.
